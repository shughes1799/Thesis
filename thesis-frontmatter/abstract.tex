\chapter{Abstract}

Meson spectroscopy aims to study the masses and decay processes of mesons to better understand the mechanics of QCD in the strong coupling (non peturbative) regime.
 The Edinburgh group are spokespersons on a major new proposal at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory called MesonEx.
   This experiment will make use of the newly upgraded 12 GeV electron beam  and detector systems to produce and measure the properties of mesons of interest for study.
    Edinburgh also leads the development of a fast timing hodoscope, part of the new forward tagger detector system that will be essential to the success of this experiment. 
    The primary focus of this thesis is the development process of the foward tagger hodoscope, from its inception up to its installation at Jefferson Lab. 
    The second half of the document will discuss meson spectroscopy analysis of the $\gamma p \rightarrow \omega\pi\pi$ decay channel.
    The data for this is taken from the g11 run of the CLAS (CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer) in hall B of Jefferson Lab.
